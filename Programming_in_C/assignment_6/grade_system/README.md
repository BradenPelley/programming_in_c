Student Grade Calculator System

Project Description:
This project is a multi-file C program that calculates a student's total marks, average, and letter grade. It demonstrates the use of functions, header files, scope, and global vs local variables.

How to Compile:

gcc main.c grade.c -o grade_program

How to Run:

./grade_program

What is a Function Prototype?:
A function prototype is a declaration of a function that tells the compiler the function's name, return type, and parameters before it is used.

What is Scope?:
Scope refers to where a variable can be accessed in a program. Global variables are accessible throughout the entire program. Local variables are only accessible inside the function where they are declared. In this project, a local variable shadows a global variable to demonstrate scope.

Why Header Files Are Used:
Header files allow multiple source files to share function declarations. They help organize code and support modular programming.
